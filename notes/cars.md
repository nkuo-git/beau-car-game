# 10 new cars, cockpits, pop-up headlights, tilt steering (content 16, 2026-10-17)

Nick asked for 10 more cars modelled from web photos. The photos were only used to look at; they are never in the game or the repo. Names are made-up badges, not real brands.

| key | button | price (萬) | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rx7` | R7 轉子跑車 | 100 | rotary sound, pop-up headlights |
| `ae86` | 86 豆腐車 | 75 | black/white, pop-up headlights |
| `altis` | 小黃 計程車 | 45 | taxi; the most common new car in traffic |
| `civic` | FK 大尾翼掀背 | 115 | |
| `evo` | E9 拉力房車 | 100 | AWD |
| `aventador` | AV12 剪刀門 | 1200 | |
| `senna` | SN8 大尾翼 | 1500 | mid-engine |
| `huayra` | HY 風神 | 4500 | mid-engine |
| `laferrari` | LF 紅色流線 | 5000 | mid-engine |
| `chiron` | C16 馬蹄超跑 | 8000 | W16, AWD |

- Each car has `<car>-look.js` / `<car>-spec.js`, a garage body (`body-*-q.glb`), a light-weight body (`body-*-lod.glb`) and wide-body settings. They are bundled in build-art.mjs / build-app.mjs through the `CARS` list. See `src/CARS-CONTRACT.md`.
- Traffic (npc.js) also uses the new cars.
- 阿財車行 has more cars than its 6 turntables. Tapping a car further down the list swaps the turntables to that batch (town.src.js `padOff`).
- Cockpits: every new car has a first-person interior (cabin.js), with a steering wheel that turns and a red top marker.

## Pop-up headlights 跳燈 (popup.js; mock https://claude.ai/artifact/NjStMe4AhSWuk9dBUELzde)
- 86 and R7 get a 「跳燈」 button next to 手煞車 (drive.js `setPop`). In portrait it sits above 手煞車; in landscape it sits to the left. The L key also works.
- Each press raises or lowers the covers and switches the lamps on or off (`popStep` animates).
- The state is saved per car in `GAME.pop` (`{car: 1}`, saved as `pop`). A borrowed car's state is not saved.
- Friends see the lamps (`pl` in `netState`).

## Tilt steering 轉手機開車
- Nick: 「你看可不可以把手機本身改成可以方向盤的模式」.
- The 「⋯」 row gets a 🎮 button: 「方向盤 按鈕 ⬅➡ / 轉手機 📱」.
- drive.js `setTilt` reads gravity from `devicemotion`. Tilting 30° is full lock; the middle 2° does nothing.
- The setting is kept per phone in `localStorage` `carid.tilt`. It is not in the save and is not moved over.
- If the phone sends no sensor data for 1.5 s, it says 「這支手機不能轉手機開車」 and switches back to buttons.
